# building-toolchain-of-cardano-using-containerization

Building a toolchain for Cardano using containerization involves creating a Docker container that contains all the necessary dependencies and tools required for compiling and running the Cardano node and CLI (Command Line Interface) applications. Docker containerization allows for the easy distribution and reproducibility of the development environment across different systems. Here's a step-by-step guide to creating the toolchain:

Step 1: Install Docker<br>
Make sure you have Docker installed on your system. Docker allows you to create, manage, and run containers. You can download Docker from the official website and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
<br>

Step 2: Create a directory for the project<br>
Create a new directory on your local machine where you will store all the necessary files for the Docker container build.
<br>

Step 3: Create the Containerfile<br>
In the directory created in Step 2, create a file named "Containerfile" (note that it is not a typo, it is "Containerfile" not "Dockerfile"). The Containerfile is similar to a Dockerfile, but it is used specifically for the build toolchain in the context of Cardano.
<br>

Step 4: Define the base image<br>
The first line of the Containerfile should specify the base image to use. Choose a suitable Linux distribution as the base image. For example, you can use Ubuntu as the base image:
<br>
Code : <br>
FROM ubuntu:latest
<br>

Step 5: Install dependencies and tools<br>
In this step, you will install all the necessary dependencies and tools required for building cardano-node and cardano-cli, including libsodium. The exact dependencies may change over time, but as of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, you can include the following packages:
<br>
Code :
<br>
RUN apt-get update && \<br>
    apt-get install -y \<br>
    libsodium-dev \<br>
    git \<br>
    libtinfo-dev \<br>
    libsystemd-dev \<br>
    pkg-config \<br>
    libgmp-dev \<br>
    libssl-dev \<br>
    make \<br>
    g++ \<br>
    jq<br>

<br>
Step 6: Install GHC (Glasgow Haskell Compiler)
<br>
Cardano is built using Haskell, and GHC is the Haskell compiler. You can install GHC by downloading the binary distribution or by building it from source. For example:
<br>
Code : 
<br>
RUN apt-get update && \<br>
    apt-get install -y wget && \<br>
    wget https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/8.10.4/ghc-8.10.4-x86_64-deb9-linux.tar.xz && \<br>
    tar -xf ghc-8.10.4-x86_64-deb9-linux.tar.xz && \<br>
    cd ghc-8.10.4 && \<br>
    ./configure && \<br>
    make install && \<br>
    cd .. && \<br>
    rm -rf ghc-8.10.4 ghc-8.10.4-x86_64-deb9-linux.tar.xz<br>
<br>

Step 7: Clone the Cardano repository<br>
Clone the Cardano repository from GitHub, so you have access to the source code.
<br>
Code : 
<br>
RUN git clone https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node.git

<br>
Step 8: Build cardano-node and cardano-cli
<br>
In this step, you need to compile the Cardano node and CLI applications. This process can take some time.
<br>
Code : 
<br>
WORKDIR /cardano-node
RUN git fetch --all --tags && \<br>
    git checkout $(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/input-output-hk/cardano-node/releases/latest | jq -r '.tag_name') && \<br>
    cabal update && \<br>
    cabal build all<br>
<br>

Step 9: Set environment variables
<br>
Set any necessary environment variables required for running the Cardano node and CLI.
<br>
Step 10: Define the entry point
<br>
Finally, specify the entry point for the Docker container. The entry point will be the command to run the Cardano node or CLI.
<br>
Code : 
<br>
ENTRYPOINT ["./cardano-node"]

<br>
Step 11: Build the Docker container<br>
Open a terminal, navigate to the directory containing the Containerfile, and build the Docker container:
<br>
Code :
<br>
docker build -t cardano-toolchain .
<br>

Step 12: Run the Cardano node or CLI
<br>
After the container is built, you can run the Cardano node or CLI commands using Docker:
<br>
Code : <br>
docker run -it cardano-toolchain cardano-node run --config mainnet-config.json
<br>

Note: Some details in the Containerfile and the steps may vary depending on the specific version of Cardano and its requirements at the time of building. Be sure to check the latest documentation and requirements for Cardano development before creating the container. Also, the "mainnet-config.json" file mentioned in the example is a placeholder and would need to be replaced with the correct configuration file for the Cardano network you want to connect to.
